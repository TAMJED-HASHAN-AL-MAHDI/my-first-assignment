            1. The programmers' <br> life is awesome. They have the potential <br> to make a lot of money, <br> even if
            they don’t work hard for it.

            2. Programmers can own their <br> time, as they can create their own <br> schedule and work on whatever <br>
            they want whenever they want to.
